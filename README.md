This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite render loop caused by a missing dependency in the `useEffect` hook.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue arises because the `useEffect` hook lacks a dependency array, causing it to re-run after every render, leading to an infinite loop.  The solution adds the `count` variable to the dependency array, ensuring the effect only runs when `count` changes.
